I am currently an Associate Professor and Ph.D. supervisor at the Shien-Ming Wu School of Intelligent Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China. I received my B.S. and M.Eng. degrees from South China University of Technology in 2014 and 2017, respectively, and my Ph.D. from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, in 2021. My research primarily focuses on Artificial Intelligence, particularly in areas such as Continual Learning. I have published over 40 papers, including 17 as the first or corresponding author, in top-tier conferences and journals such as ICML, NeurIPS, CVPR, AAAI, ACM MM, and IEEE Transactions. I am a guest editor for JFI, co-chair of WSPML2023, and publicity chair for the CSIG Young Scientists' Forum. In 2021, I was awarded the NSFC Outstanding Overseas Student Award.

Our lab, the Machine Intelligence and Learning Adaptation Lab (MILA), welcomes motivated students to apply and participate in our research activities, including undergraduates.
